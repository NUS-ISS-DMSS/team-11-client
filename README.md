# 👨🏻‍💻 Our Workflow

1. Head to the `main` branch and `git pull` to get the most current code.
2. Create a new branch and name it accordingly. (Ensure you create new branches **from** `main` branch)
3. `push` the `branch` to the remote repository.
4. Work on your code and make `commit`s.
5. When you're done with your task, make a pull request on GitHub.
6. Write a short description for the reviewer and briefly explain what changes have you made.
7. Rinse and repeat~
